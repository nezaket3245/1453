Egepen Akçayapı needs a modern, high-performance website to:
- Replace outdated or nonexistent online presence

2. **Trust** — Homeowners need proof of quality (Egepen brand, 40 years, warranty, reviews) before making large purchases
3. **Education** — Products are technical; customers need specifications, comparisons, and guides
4. **Lead Capture** — Visitors should easily reach the business via phone, contact form, or visiting the showroom
